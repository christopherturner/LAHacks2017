# accuFact

accuFact is a tool built to shed light on real news.  Drawing from multiple news outlets, our platform algorithmically features articles that demonstrate credibility.  Our approach is bilateral, factoring in both the prior credibility of a given source (based on both preeminence and peer-review) and the popularity of each particular article.

## News Retrieval

accuFact retrieves live stories using [News API](https://newsapi.org).  Using this integration, articles from 72 worldwide sources can be obtained in a `JSON` format including their title, a brief description, a corresponding image, and more.

## Backend/Frontend

accuFact is built using `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JS`.  We've implemented the `React` framework for extensibility and scaling options.  Our project is hosted on `GitHub`, deployed on `Heroku`, and uses a `Namecheap`-registered domain name.
